Pseduocode: Method used to describe algorithms using a combination of natural language and high level programming constructs
    - Outline for a program
    - How code would work
    - Natural language ( no syntax obligations )
    - Recipe / Instructions for a computer program
    
    Needs:
    - Conditional Statements ( integral part of your pseduocode )
    1. Should be clear enough to be readable
    2. Simplicity and concise
    3. Flexibility

Each algorithm must have an input and output statement or criteria.

Example 1: Finding the Maximum Value in a List
Input: A List of numbers ( L )
Output: The maximum (greatest) number in the list ( L )

Step 1: maxValue <- L[0]
Step 2: for each number ( n ) in L, starting from the second element
Step 3: if  n > maxValue then
            maxValue <- n
        end for
        return maxValue

.strip() --> removes extra spaces
.lower() --> forces input to be lowercase
