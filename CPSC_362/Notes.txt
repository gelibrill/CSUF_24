Product Based vs Service Based
    - Venmo is service based
        - Service based allows for a lot of project growth, but not as much pay
    - video games are product based
        - not necessarily have a client.

SW engineering vs SW process
- engineering is the building
- process is the steps taken and the scheduling and requirements
    - iterative process: agile, waterfall, XP
    - agile is good for flexible projects that are changing often
    - waterfall for more linear process
    - scrum breaking project down to mulit pieces
    - kanban visualizing process
